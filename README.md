My attempts at implementing machine learning algorithms

### Install

``` python
pip install git+https://github.com/bradleypick/mymlimp.git@master
```

**Note**:

Currently in the throws of an overhaul - changes will be frequent.

The purpose of this repository is a place to demonstrate and store some of
the things I am learning in the UBC MDS program.
